# Introduction

Good day. My name is Samuel Effiong Jacob, and today, I’m excited to present a scalable, user-focused financial application that empowers users to manage multiple wallets with unique types and features.

- **Problem Statement:**  
Managing multiple financial accounts can be cumbersome, especially when different accounts have specific requirements like minimum balances or interest rates. Furthermore, transferring money securely and seamlessly between accounts is a challenge for many users.

## 2. The Solution

- **Overview:**  
Our application is a wallet management system designed to address these challenges. It allows users to create and manage multiple wallets, each linked to a specific type, with features such as minimum balance enforcement, customizable interest rates, and seamless money transfers.

- **Key Features:**  
  1. **Multiple Wallet Types:** Users can create wallets of different types, each with a unique name, minimum balance, and monthly interest rate.  
  2. **Secure Transactions:** Wallets can send and receive money while ensuring sufficient balance is available for transfers.  
  3. **Real-Time Validation:** Rules like minimum balance enforcement and transaction integrity are automated using database triggers and application logic.  
  4. **Comprehensive API:** Our system includes endpoints for user and wallet management, and detailed transaction handling, making it extensible and easy to integrate into other platforms.

## 3. Technical Implementation

- **Database Design:**  
  - Our database includes four core tables:  
    - **Users**: Stores user information such as name, email, phone, and a unique user ID.  
    - **Wallet Types**: Defines wallet characteristics, including minimum balance and interest rates.  
    - **Wallets**: Represents individual wallets linked to users and wallet types.  
    - **Transactions**: Logs all money transfers with status tracking for success, pending, or failed transactions."

- **Logic Automation:**  
  - We’ve implemented two MySQL triggers:  
    - **Minimum Balance Enforcement:** Prevents wallet balances from dropping below the required minimum.  
    - **Improved Transaction Logic:** Validates sender balances before transfers and ensures real-time balance updates for both sender and receiver wallets."

- **API Integration:**  
  - Using Laravel, we’ve built a robust RESTful API that supports:  
    - Retrieving all users.  
    - Viewing wallet details, including type and balance.  
    - Transferring money securely between wallets.  
    - Validating and enforcing business rules through observers and middleware.
